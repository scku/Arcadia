####Motivation
I grew up in the city of Arcadia and have seen it change throughout the years. Arcadia has always been an affluent suburban but the demographics, econimical, and social characteristics have noticeably shifted over the past decade. I wanted to mine, gather, and analyze the data to put some concrete numbers to quantify these changes. 

So far, I've focused on gathering and analzying the housing prices in recent years.
